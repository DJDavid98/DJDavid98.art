    "heading": "About Me",
    "p1": "I’m a hobbyist digital artist who loves drawing animals in his free time. My personal favourite species are foxes, but I like canines in general, besides other four-legged creatures. I consider myself to be part of the larger furry community. I occasionally participate in related events to relax, or to hang out with friends.",
    "p2": "In addition to creating art myself, I also have a tendency to support independent artists from the furry fandom in the form of purchasing commissions featuring various original characters, ranging from my own to friends’ or even the artists’.",
    "p3": "When I'm not drawing, my favorite activities include listening to music, watching movies or series, and playing video games. You can find my favourites at the links in the contact section below. My native language is Hungarian, but I'm also fluent in English and I'm actively trying to learn Russian."

    "p2": "Fear not, for this placeholder text shall bring your attention to the button below which links to my artist tag where you will be able to see all the same works (provided the site itself is still alive and well).",
    "p3": "It might not be as fancy as this awesome gallery I had set up for you here, but it is what it is, I don't make the rules. It's a shame really, I would have loved for you to see it. Maybe check back a bit later? Sorry :("
