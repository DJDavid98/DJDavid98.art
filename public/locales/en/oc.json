        "fox": "I'm a lone vixen, taking my time wandering around my home forest by my lonesome exploring and trying to find my purpose. I consider myself an introvert; I'm very shy and afraid of meeting new creatures. If you genuinely want to get to know me, be yourself and be honest, and if I see that your intentions are pure I'm not afraid of opening up. If you just want to take advantage of me you can be sure I will see right through you and you'll be lucky if I don't get up and leave immediately. The only creatures I unconditionally trust in this forest are the flowers who've been keeping me company for as long as I can remember. I've dedicated my life to get to know them and cater to their every need to the best of my abilities, and in turn they do the same for me. I guess you could say we all have a… <1>symbiotic</1> relationship~",
        "pony": "I'm a shy, introverted unicorn mare spending most of my time indoors accompanied by my PC and a bunch of snacks. My favourite foods are potato chips and many kinds of pizzas, hawaiian included. I'm a big fan of electronic music, and if I need to drown out some background noise I always keep a playlist ready. I'm not one to start conversations or make the first move when meeting new creatures, but if you manage to get me talking about something that interests me we will likely get along just fine. Don't just ask to be friends, I simply don't have that mindset. Reaching that level of trust is a process that cannot be rushed, and if you want to get anywhere close to me, don't expect to speedrun it. Every once in a while I also tend to make some doodles to practice drawing, but I find a lot more joy in supporting others who are considerably more experienced by commissioning drawings of me (and occasionally my friends) <1>having fun</1>~"
